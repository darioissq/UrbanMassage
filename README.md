Urban  Massage  iOS  Engineer  â€“  Technical  Test  Implement  an  app  that  contains  location  tracking.    The  only  UI  necessary  will  be  a  single  view,  containing  the  current  location,  authorisation  status,  and  the  last  upload  time.  The  app  should  upload  the  location  to  a  remote  API  via  HTTP  (you  can  use  request  bin).  Locations  should  be  uploaded  at  10-15  minute  intervals.  If  this  is  not  possible,  explain  why,  and  describe  any  compromises  that  could  get  towards  the  original  solution
